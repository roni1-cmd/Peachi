Peachi OS

Peachi OS is a custom operating system built on top of the Linux kernel.  
It inherits the power and flexibility of Linux, with a focus on modern, user-centered customization.

Peachi OS is built on the Linux kernel.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
`Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst` first.

In order to build the documentation, use `make htmldocs` or
`make pdfdocs`. The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

   https://coreastarstroupe.netlify.app/papers

There are various text files in the `Documentation/` subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the `Documentation/process/changes.rst` file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

This customized kernel is part of **Peachi OS**, and may include additional modules, patches, or configuration presets specific to the Peachi environment. While based on upstream Linux, Peachi OS introduces its own goals and ecosystem.

> This is not an official Linux release.  
> Peachi OS is an independent project built on the official Linux kernel.
